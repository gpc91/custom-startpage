# Startpage

## What is a start page?
Startpages are locally hosted webpages that load as a homepage or new tab page in a web browser.

## Setup
### Weather
Currently you will need to go into the developer tools > 'local storage' and add a new key "owm_key" which contains your openweathermap.org API key. Without it, it is not possible to display weather information.
